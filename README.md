# Deep Learning Course Education Material 
This repository contains the educational material including lab notebooks, assignments, and lecture material for the course Deep Learning of the Engineering with AI Minor programme, EEMCS, TUDelft (edition 2024-2025).

The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of neural networks and their applications. The material covers theoretical aspects and programming exercises implemented with PyTorch. Students are assumed to be familiar with basic machine learning concepts such as regression, classification, supervised/unsupervised learning, linear perceptron.
Key topics include:

- Feedforward Neural networks 
- Maximum Likelihood
- Gradient-based optimization
- Convolutional Neural networks 
- Transfer learning
- Regularization
- Recurrent Neural networks
- Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning

## Folder Structure
The materials for the course is organized into different folders.
- **Lectures/** contains all lecture slides which cover mostly explanation and exercises on theoretical concepts

- **Lab Notebooks/**  contains Python Jupyter notebooks with guided programming exercises and insight questions. Solutions notebooks are also included. These notebooks are also available in Kaggle. See for instance [Lab1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/econgeduti/lab-1)

- **Complementary Notebooks/** contains additional mini-notebooks used as supplementary material and exercises for practical understanding of the concepts explained. 

- **Assignments/**  contains the two assignments of the course.
