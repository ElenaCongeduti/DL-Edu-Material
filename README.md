# Deep Learning Course - Educational Material 

This repository contains educational materials, including lab notebooks, assignments, and lecture materials for the course *Deep Learning* in the Engineering with AI Minor program, EEMCS, TUDelft (edition 2024-2025).

## Content Overview
The course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of neural networks and their applications. The material covers both theoretical concepts and programming exercises implemented using PyTorch. Students are expected to be familiar with basic machine learning concepts, such as regression, classification, supervised and unsupervised learning, and linear perceptrons.

Key topics include:
- Feedforward Neural networks 
- Maximum Likelihood
- Gradient-based optimization
- Convolutional Neural networks 
- Transfer learning
- Regularization
- Recurrent Neural networks
- Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning


## Folder Structure
The material is organized into the following folders:
- **Lectures/**: lecture slides
- **LabNotebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks (lab+solution lab) with programming exercises and insight questions. Also available on Kaggle, e.g., [Lab1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/econgeduti/lab-1) and [Lab1(Solutions)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/econgeduti/lab-1-solutions).
- **ComplementaryMaterial/**: additional mini-notebooks or other material for supplementary exercises or simulations for practical understanding of concepts explained in class.
- **Assignments/**: small deep learning projects given as course assignments.
